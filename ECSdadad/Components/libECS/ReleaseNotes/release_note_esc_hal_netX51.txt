1.1.0.0  AO    06.06.2012 Changed Mailbox ESC read/write calls to use the actual mailbox size value used by ESM to check mailbox parameters
                          Changed: access now DWORD only to improve access time for process data exchange (especially in netX6 use case)
                          Changed: all sync manager protected areas DWORD-aligned, added two examples to support non-DWORD multiple Sync manager length   
                          added: netX6 support
                          added: RUN/ERR or STATUS LED controlled by ESC (xPEC); deleted software-based LED handler from main()
                          deleted: OSAL (now implemented by common_func.h/c)
                          requirement for IRQ locks checked and commented
                          added: irq_handler.h/c added to introduce public calls to ESC_ProcPortInterrupt/Esc_ProcPortInterrupt2/Esc_SyncPortInterrupt
                          structured SII image instead of fixed arrays 
1.1.1.0  AO    16.07.2012 Added support for HXHX52-RE
                          Removed double calls to Esm_WriteAlStatusByEsm
         AO    22.08.2012 Changed: Build to 2
                          Bugfix: Receive time stamping in case of processing via OUT port (f.e. when node is last one in line but connected to OUT port)
1.1.2.0  AO    29.08.2012 Deleted ALStatus Debug code
                          Bugfix: lost interrupts when using serial DPM due changing to level-triggered interrupt
                          Support of serial DPM with speed=50 MBaud
                          Bugfix: initialize DPM failed when compiled in "released" build instead of "debug" build 
1.1.3.0  IO    06.11.2012 Changed: Build to 3
                          Bugfix: wrong calculation of SysTime difference when master_clock wrapped
1.1.4.0  IO    22.11.2012 updating HAL documentation                      
1.2.0.0  BI    13.11.2014 Changed: Refactoring of data types in HAL API
                          Deleted: Esc_TriggerPdiWdg()
                          Changed: Reworked example application
1.3.0.0  AO    05.02.2015 Changed: Build to 20
                          Removed: PDI Watchdog functionality
                          Removed: Hilscher specific PI-based DC control algorithm 
                          Bugfix: ARMW: if Position Bit15 set then Command was ignored instead of writing 
                          Added: ESC_EVENT_MSK Register shadowed
                          Added: FMMU and SyncManager Configuration Registers shadowed
                          Bugfix: Ethernet frame corruption when accessing physical register areas 0xa00..0xfff
                          Changed: Register 0x990 ("System time of next SYNC0 pulse in ns") and Register 0x998 ("System time of next SYNC1 pulse in ns") latched altogether when detecting read access at register area 0x980..0x9A7; Earlier ESC Builds latch both System times individually when detect read access to register address 0x990/0x998
                          Bugfix: Ethernet frame reception errors in case of Ethernet frame is VLAN-Tagged or with IP/UDP header in connection with large Ethernet clock drifts
                          Bugfix: Reset value of Station Address (Address 0x0010) changed from 0xdead to 0x0000
                          Removed: hardware support for RUN/ERR and STATUS LED driving
                          Bugfix: Mailbox SyncManager is disabled on conflicting PD SyncManager changes
                          Bugfix: DC StartTime CyclicOp (0x990..0x993) corrupted if read before activation of cyclic unit (0x981.0 = 1)
1.3.0.1  AO    24.04.2015 Changed: Build to 21
                          Added: UDP-CRC set to 0x0000 in processing and forwarding direction
                          Added in ESI: <Mailbox DataLinkLayer="true">
                          Added within HAL Example: if DIP switch (ID-selector) set to zero then Configured Station Alias register (0x12) set to netX specific value (e.g. netX100/500: 500, netX50: 50, ...)
