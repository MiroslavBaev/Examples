  - CFI parallel flash driver did not return flash geometry data
  - CFI parallel flash driver causes crash when writing until the end of the last sector
  - CFI parallel flash driver may erase an additional sector (next sector)
  - Drv_PflEraseFlashDevice() did not do anything  
  - Mid_FatNormalizeFilename() did not work with filenames without base name (e.g. ".a")
    These files could not be deleted as the function returned "." as normalized filename

  - GPIO driver does not enable IRQs if fIrq is set in RX_GPIO_SET_T
  - GPIO Driver does not set Threshold / Capture value

   during power up sequence (e.g. Micrel KSZ8041NL)

V2.0.8.10 (09.12.2011)
---------------------
Bugfix:
 - Mid_FatGetDiskFree may return wrong free space for FAT_12 filesystems
   This may result in a error during downloads via DPM/USB/Serial

V2.0.8.9 (01.12.2011)
---------------------
Bugfix:
 - FAT12 does not work using sector sizes that are not a multiple of 12 bits
   ATTENTION: Previously FAT12 formatted disks that used sector sizes that were
              not multiple of 12 bits, will need to be reformatted, as they are
              not FAT conform.

V2.0.8.8 (28.09.2011)
---------------------
 - HIF: Added mirroring of Handshake cells for hosts that don't support RDY signals

V2.0.8.0 (05.05.2010)
---------------------
 Bugfix:
  - Timer interrupts may be lost on netX50 when multiple hardware timers are used
    When using custom IRQ clearing code for the GPIO module the write to
    NETX_CNTR_IRQ_RAW / NETX_GPIO_IRQ_RAW must be replaced by a call to
    netX50ConfirmGpioIrq

    Example: netX50ConfirmGpioIrq(NETX_CNTR_IRQ_RAW, MSK_NETX_CNTR_IRQ_RAW_cnt2);

  - Promiscious mode may be active after EDD initialization
  - netX50: Security Memory readout may take longer if netX system time is modified
  - Drv_SflWriteFlash: Writing of partial data inside a flash page results in
    corrupted data in this page

 Added:
  - Bus synchronous support functions into HIF driver
  - CFI compliant parallel flash support. This only includes raw access to flash
    sectors (read/write/erase), but not filesystem. Call HalPflsInitialize_CFI
    for using this driver

 Updated:
  - netX50: Exported Variable g_ulDrvSpiOpenCnt in Drv_Spi to allow interrupt
    sharing for the two different SPI busses

    with ulDest = 0x20

V2.0.6.0 (28.01.2010)
---------------------
 Updated:
  - Standard Ethernet MAC and 2 Port Switch updated to HAL 3.1.0.0 (RPU and TPU are now the same for 2Port and Standard MAC)
 Bugfix:
  - If PHY reset fails(e.g. invalid MDIO address), rcX stuck in an endless startup.
    Changed so that after 100ms the Reset is aborted and HAL_PHY_ACCESS_ERROR is returned
  - Uart may cause framing errors when used with Baudrates between 9600 / 19200 due to clock divider in UART causing a
    baudrate deviance of approx 0,66%
  - Mid_FatDelete() blocks if directory contains more than one cluster
  - Mid_FatReadFile() read past end of file
  - Drv_XcResetXc updated (fixes problems with XC startup on some microcodes)

V2.0.5.0 (16.12.2009)
---------------------
 Bugfix:
  - USB CDC Emulation did not answer correctly to string requests during enumeration phase.
  - Drv_MMCMount was unable to mount SD/MMC cards with an internal sector size != 512 (usually cards bigger than 1GB).
    MidFatInitialize returned error MID_FAT_READ_ERROR in this case
  - MMC Driver : CSD Parameters for read/write access times were evaluated wrong. This resulted in read/write errors on some cards
  - 2Port Switch may call application's send confirmation callback twice, even
    if fMultipleCnf is not set
  - XC units are now completely reset if Drv_XcResetXc is called for RX_TYPE_XC_XPEC, as it is not possible to
    reset single subunits. Only complete XC reset (XPEC, RPU/TPU) works under all circumstances. XC Reset modified
    according to latest SimpleLoader Routines from HAL-Examples.
  - RCX_GET_EXTENDED_STATE_REQ now returns correct data

  Added:
  - Drv_Urt now supports USB cdc emulation using the internal USB core.
  - Drv_Urt has a new function "Drv_UrtGetLastError" which allows readout of the last happened error. This
    function should be called in the Error Notification callback to check the occured error.

  Added: (03.11.2009)
  - TLR_ExtDevStat supports creating extended device status fields at DPM
  - DMA functions: Drv_HifSetupDMA, Drv_HifEnableDMA, Drv_HifEnableDMACallback, Drv_HifDisableDMACallback, Drv_HifSetComCosDMA
  - Add DeviceIdNumber to DPM
  - Update boottokens
  - Support for auto-detecting M25PE80, M45PE40, M45PE80

  - Drv_Pio should is now able to handle multiple PIO_SETS independently

V2.0.4.5 (17.12.2008)
---------------------
 Bugfix:
  - incorrect FAT handling results in Volume full after downloading file several times

---------------------
 Added:
  - SD/MMC Driver module for use with MidFat module

  - new packets for system channel blocks and communication control

 Bugfix:
  - DrvVolGetEntry always returned RX_OK (even if given volume was not available)
  - Mid_FatFormat did not format correctly in seldom cases (usually DrvRdk),
    if previously found FAT has been corrupted during system start

 Changes:
  - Internal changes in RX_SYSTEM task (MidSys module)

V2.0.4.3 (07.08.2008)
---------------------
 Added:
  - Crypto flash License update (Download mode)
  - Function to query netX Chip type (rX_DevGetChiptype)
  - iniBatch (to startup stacks without support for DBM files)

 Changed:
  - Internal Structure of XC Driver changed, to allow License update
  - Adopted Crypto Flash driver, to changes in XC driver
  - PHY driver changed to support Initializing the PHY's in different configurations (e.g. no Auto-Neg, no AutoMDIX)
  - 2Port Switch and Standard Ethernet MAC do not re-initialize the PHY anymore. The previously set parameters from DrvPhy are used.

 Bugfix:
  - Disabling System Status LEDs independently did not work
  - Internal miscalculation of ethernet frame buffer for Standard Ethernet MAC
    on Port 1
  - Licenseinformation not always correctly read (MMU/Caching errors during DMA of XPEC)
  - writing of Zone3 did not work (did write non-inverted data, while reading delivers inverted data)
  - Read/Write of crypto flash zones did not work correctly.

  * netX50
   - Only one SPI interface was usable, due to the interrupt being shared between SPI0/SPI1

V2.0.4.2 (29.04.2008)
---------------------
 Changed:
  *netX100/500
    - Xpec Reset changed to reset DMA controller earlier (adopted to latest simple loader from HALs)
  * Doing a system start via DPM/Packet now clears the SYSSTA Leds before executing the reset

 Bugfix:
  * Some XC microcodes could result in total netX crash after a XCReset. All microcodes delivered with rcX (Cryptoflash, Ethernet)
    were checked for this behaviour.

-------------------
 Added:
  - Packet to set MAC address via DPM (for non-crypto flash operation)
  - Startup speed improved (fast startup preparation)

-------------------
 Added:
  - Function Mid_DbmGetDatabaseProperty (Database module)

  - RX_SYSTEM task's queues can now be adjusted in size through global variable (for lower memory usage)

V2.0.4.1 (14.03.2008)
---------------------
 Bugfix:
  - SystemStart via DPM caused XPEC to be enabled instead of disabled. This could
    result in a system crash, or instable system behaviour.
  - 2Port Switch. Explicitely sending on Port1 does not work.

V2.0.4.0 (04.03.2008)
---------------------
 Bugfix:
  - Hilfileheader.h deliviered was an old version.
  - Drv_SysTimeCompareTimestamps() illegally returned a>b if both stamps are equal
  - Cryptoflash: Reading of zone1 delivered wrong data

 Changed:

-------------------
 Bugfix netX100/500:

-------------------
 Bugfix:
  - Opening a DBM file with the same name in different directories did not work
  - HIF Driver now supports writing the protocol class, etc. to DPM (Function : Drv_HifSetChannelInfoData)

     * Sending frames was broken

B2.0.4.0_2007_12_05_1415
------------------------
Bugfix:
 - 2Port Switch caused Access violation on receive frames

Changed:
 - Ethernet / 2Port Switch now uses different RPU/TPU microcodes. Use the following definitions
    * Ethernet     : XC_CODE_ETH_STD_TPU / XC_CODE_ETH_STD_RPU
    * 2Port Switch : XC_CODE_ETH_2PORT_SWITCH_TPU / XC_CODE_ETH_2PORT_SWITCH_RPU
